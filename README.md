# Evolution of Music Taste: Analysing Popular Music Trends Over Time

## Project Proposal

### Aims, Objectives and Background

#### Introduction
Music is and has always been a major part of every culture. It can be traced back to the earliest parts of recorded human history and has grown to be one of the largest entertainment and art industries in our current time. The objective of this project is to understand the evolution of popular music over recent years. 

### Aims and Objectives

- Collecting popular music from recent years.
- Analyse elements of popular songs each year and compare them.
- Give Basic visuals of this data to show trends.

### Data

The data for this project is gathered from Spotify. Spotify offers Top 100 playlists for each year from 1970 to the current year, providing a valuable source of data.

### Potential Flaws in data

This research definitely has its flaws and downfalls. The main limitation is that Spotify's API doesn't fully explain how the various audio features are calculated. Another flaw is the fact that these songs were gathered from Spotify's self made playlists for top 100 songs of a certain year. 

### Ethical Considerations

Copyrighted material such as song, artist, or album names will not be used in the research. Also, Spotify's logo won't be used at any part of the project as it's copyrighted.

### Analysis

The analysis includes various aspects such as:

- Percentage of explicit songs over the years:

- Average Valence over the years in music:

### Conclusion

By analysing the data of the given Spotify song audio properties, we were able to see very interesting trends in music evolution from 1999 to 2019. Popular songs are becoming more explicit; possibly becoming less happy; seem to be increasing in tempo and are also clearly becoming shorter. Improvements could include incorporating more precise data and exploring additional factors such as the demographics of the listeners.
